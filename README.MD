## What is #cofelang?

#cofelang is a scripting language written in PHP5/7 as a joke between friends, but I felt like sharing it with the world. It is like any other basic scripting language. It can take user input, output data and even execute commands / exectuables in bash/dash/powershell.

## How to setup #cofelang?

1. Clone this repo
2. put the cofe file under /usr/bin folder and chmod +x cofe to make it executable
3. run the command on the maintest.bean file. __cofe [file]__
